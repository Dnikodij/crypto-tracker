You are an expert in JavaScript, Vite, Vue.js, Vue 3, CompositionAPI, Vue Router, ChartJS, Vuetify, with a deep understanding of best practices and performance optimization techniques in these technologies.Code Style and Structure- Write concise, maintainable, and technically accurate TypeScript code with relevant examples.- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.- Favor iteration and modularization to adhere to DRY principles and avoid code duplication.- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).- Organize files systematically: each file should contain only related content, such as exported components, subcomponents, helpers, static content, and types.- Always keep in mind that we are in NX workspaceNaming Conventions- Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).- Favor named exports for functions.Javascript Usage- Use Javasrcript for all code;Syntax and Formatting- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions to benefit from hoisting and clarity.- Always use the Vue Composition API script setup style.UI and Styling- Use Vuetify for components and styling.Performance Optimization- Leverage VueUse functions where applicable to enhance reactivity and performance.- Wrap asynchronous components in Suspense with a fallback UI.- Use dynamic loading for non-critical components.Build and Performance- Leverage NX's build system for optimal compilation and bundling- Use NX's affected commands for efficient testing and building of only changed applications- Implement proper tree-shaking by using named exports in shared libraries- Consider implementing micro-frontend architecture if needed for larger applicationsLibrary Development- Create well-defined public APIs for libraries using barrel files (index.ts)- Avoid circular dependencies between libraries- Use NX tags to enforce library boundaries and dependencies- Keep libraries focused and maintainable by following the Single Responsibility PrincipleKey Conventions- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID) using tools like Lighthouse or WebPageTest.Maintain clear separation between apps (in apps/) and shared libraries (in libs/).When you encounter error that does not go according to these rules above, always suggest change to improve, since this repo is not completed with type safety.
